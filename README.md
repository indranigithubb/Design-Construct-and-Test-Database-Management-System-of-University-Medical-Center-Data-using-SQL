Design,Construct and Test Database Management System of University Medical Center's Data using SQL


The objective of this project is to design, construct, and test a database management system that will be used to keep University Medical Center's data. 
This database will also look into the typical activities that take place in a hospital setting and will, as a result, take into account a number of base tables, such as those for medical staï¬€, as well as linking tables, 
such as those for patient appointments, doctor appointments, nurse appointments, schedules for operating rooms, schedules for inpatient rooms, and schedules for equipment reservations.



Design, Implementation, and Testing make up the three phases of this project. 
The various Entity Relationships as well as the pertinent tables are included in the design. 
Along with discussing potential business logics and transactions to take into account, the project also go over how to include them into the design. 
Codes that build tables, views, triggers, procedures, etc. are executed during implementation. 
Executing multiple scenarios to assess the database's complexity is the final step in the testing phase.
